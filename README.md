# StopAskingGMU
Hey GMU students! Are you tired of having to click that "do not ask again" button every time you log in to something only for it to forget instantly? Well not any more. This is a tiny extension that automatically clicks past that page for you, selecting "do not ask again" just in case. The code is very short, simple, and fully open-source, so even non-programmers can see that I'm not trying to steal your information.

[Install in Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/stopaskinggmu/memjepmledaojhndmlkcjopkikmlokpb)

## Manual installation
### Chrome/Edge
1. Extract the folder somewhere
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/` in your browser
3. Enable the litte developer mode switch
4. Click the new "Load unpacked" button
5. Select the extension's folder

### Firefox
At the moment, I do not know if there is a way to properly install extensions in Firefox unless you have the developer version. The following instructions will install this as a temporary extension, meaning you need to repeat the steps every time you restart the browser.
1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in your browser
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
4. Select the extension's ZIP file
5. (optional) Go to `about:addons`, click on the extension's settings, and allow it to run in private mode
